## Backend Setup

- For products data will be saved in JSON Server
- You must upload the file to [cloudinary API ](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference) (prefer using unsigned cloudinary).
- Save the cloudinary link to the JSON server

For simplicity you can upload the file when you click upload file button, but you can approach another way by uploading when submit button clicked after all the file has been uploaded to cloudinary, you can pass the url to json-server. it's up to you to choose the way of uploading. you must comment the reason why you choose the way [see [**notes**](#notes)]. (don't forget to give loading ui when uploading image to cloudinary and submit data to json-server). Disable submit button if there is error validated in data.

cases:

- If successful, the data will be sent to the JSON server with the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "Product name",
  "price": 200000,
  "weight": 10,
  "width": 10,
  "length": 10,
